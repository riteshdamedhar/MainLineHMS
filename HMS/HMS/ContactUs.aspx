        In spring 1827, Jameson went a different direction and secured a charter from Washington 
        College in Washington, Pennsylvania. At the time, it was only 1 of 2 instances where a 
        college had chartered an institution outside of state.The new school, Washington Medical 
        College, was located on Holliday Street, between Saratoga and Lexington, opposite city hall. 
        While it issued degrees, Washington College did not take a strong leadership role in the 
        development of the medical school. Washington Medical College grew quickly, especially in 
        light of issues with the management of University of Maryland Medical School.

        President Hoover created the Veterans Administration (VA) in 1930 to consolidate all 
        veteran services. General Omar N. Bradley was appointed to VA administrator and Bradley
        appointed Major General Paul Hawley as director of VA medicine, both in 1945. Hawley
        successfully established a policy that affiliated new VA hospitals with medical schools.
        Hawley also promoted resident and teaching fellowships at VA hospitals. Ultimately,
        Hawley was responsible for starting the hospital-based research program at the VA.

        The quality of the patient–physician relationship is important to both parties. 
        The relationship is one that is built in terms of mutual respect, knowledge, trust. 
        Additionally, the doctor and patient's values and perspectives about disease, life,
         and time available play a role in building up this relationship. A strong relationship 
        between the doctor and patient will lead to frequent, quality information about the 
        patient's disease. Enhancing the accuracy of the diagnosis and increasing the patient's
         knowledge about the disease all come with a good relationship.
